1)

Setting the current working directory to gcha0008_sci1022_assignment_answer we can then create a directory in the current directory

$ cd ~/Documents/gcha0008_sci1022_assignment_answer

$ mkdir ebooks

We can then use curl to get hamlet from the internet

$ curl http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2265/pg2265.txt -o ebooks/hamlet.txt

  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

$ ls ebooks
hamlet.txt

And so we have successfully downloaded the Tragedie of Hamlet by William Shakespeare eBook in text format where the file is located at ~/ebooks and is named as hamlet.txt

2)

First setting the current working directory to /usr/lib

$ cd /usr/lib/

**Absolute Path**

/usr/lib$ ls -rtl /home/gcha0008/Documents/gcha0008_sci1022_assignment_answer/ebooks

total 184
-rw-rw-r--+ 1 gcha0008 Domain Users 184406 Mar 18 20:29 hamlet.txt		

**Relative Path**

/usr/lib$ ls -rtl ../../home/gcha0008/Documents/gcha0008_sci1022_assignment_answer/ebooks
total 184
-rw-rw-r--+ 1 gcha0008 Domain Users 184406 Mar 18 20:29 hamlet.txt

And thus we obtain both size in bytes and the permissions of hamlet.txt through the absolute path and relative path.

3)

Setting the current working directory to ~/Documents/gcha0008_sci1022_assignment_answer/ebooks 

$ cd ~/Documents/gcha0008_sci1022_assignment_answer/ebooks

$ wc hamlet.txt

  5307  32252 184406 hamlet.txt

wc can be used to get the lines, words and bytes of hamlet.txt. As can be seen, the bytes of Question 2 and the bytes of Question 3 are both 184406 bytes.

4)

In a single- line command to output line #3447, we use the absolute domain of hamlet.txt in conjuction with head, tail and command pipelining.

$ head -n 3447 ~/Documents/gcha0008_sci1022_assignment_answer/ebooks/hamlet.txt | tail -n 1
Is thought-sicke at the act

So we find that Is thought-sicke at the act is line #3447 in hamlet.txt.

5)

Grep can be used with the flag -i so that we have case-insensitive matching. wc with flag -l will display the number of lines containing hamlet and/or Hamlet when used with command pipelining.

$ grep -i hamlet ~/Documents/gcha0008_sci1022_assignment_answer/ebooks/hamlet.txt | wc -l
109 

And so 109 lines have hamlet and/or Hamlet.
